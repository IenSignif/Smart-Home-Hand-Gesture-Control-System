# Smart-Home-Hand-Gesture-Control-System
This project is composed of two parts, first is using P-NUCLEO-F401RE with a micro lidar for detecting and labeling hand gesture and 2nd is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B for the Smart Home user interface. I use a code as a base from bluemelony12 project and edited it.
